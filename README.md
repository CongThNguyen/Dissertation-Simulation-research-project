This project involved creating a simulation environment, observing and analyzing how different dispatching protocols (or dispatching algorithms) can have an effect on the overall performances of the system.

This project is required for an award of Master of Science and it took roughly less than 4 months to complete. The project was composed in LaTeX (Overleaf) which is a cloud text writing and document editing platform for scientific document writing.
