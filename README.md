# Master-degree-thesis (University of Edinburgh)
Above you may find the PDF file of my Master's degree dissertation (Supervised by [Dr.Burak Buke](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~bbuke/bio/)). Please click on the pdf file to view it.

This project involved creating a simulation environment, observing and analyzing how different dispatching protocols (or dispatching algorithms) can have an effect on the overall performance of the system.

The successful completion of the dissertation is a strict requiqurement for the award of Master of Science (*MSc*) and it took roughly less than 4 months to complete. The project was composed in LaTeX (Overleaf) which is a cloud text writing and document editing platform for scientific document writing.
