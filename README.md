This project is about observing and analyzing how different dispatching protocols (or dispatching algorithms) used by ride-hailing companies such as: Uber, Lyft... may affect the overall performances of the system.

This project is required for an award of Master of Science and it took me roughly less than 4 months to complete. If you have any questions, feel free to reach me at: cong.ngnt@gmail.com

Thank you for your interest !
